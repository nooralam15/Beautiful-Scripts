# Reducing Repetition: Python Scripts for Efficiency ðŸš€

As an engineering student, I do way too many repetitive tasks, especially in assignments.  

- Computing repetitive truth tables  
- Constant matrix operations  
- Repetitive tasks on Excel, etc.  

I decided to create a series of Python scripts that will help reduce redundancy and repetition!  

Keep an eye out! This repository will be updated regularly. ðŸ”„
